\title{Generate edge list from a distance matrix
Duplicates are not deleted, because they will not be counted
by Kruskal's algorithm
If a check is O(1), this only adds an O(E) overhead, which is negligible}

gen.edge.list(mat)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{The distance matrix.}
}
\value{
A data frame with three columns: 'from', 'to', 'dist'.
